This terraform module provide resources to manage Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering connections. A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.

The following resources will be created:

 - A VPC requester - VPC that sends a request to the owner of the accepter VPC to create the VPC peering connection
 - A VPC Accepter - VPC  that accepts the VPC peering connection request to activate the VPC peering connection.
 - A route table  - That contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.
 - Network Access Control list (ACL) - NACLs provide a rule-based tool for controlling network traffic ingress and egress at the protocol and subnet level.
